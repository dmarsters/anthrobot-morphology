# ==============================================================================
# INTENTIONALITY - Layer 2 (Why This Works)
# ==============================================================================

intentionality:
  core_principle:
    concept: "Morphological Attractor States"
    explanation: |
      Adult cells, freed from tissue-level constraints, navigate morphospace
      toward stable forms determined by physical forces, bioelectric patterns,
      and collective cell intelligence - not genetic programming alone.
    
    levin_framework: |
      Cells are not passive agents following blueprints. They are problem-solving
      agents with inherent competencies navigating toward "target morphologies"
      from a Platonic space of possible forms. The genome provides hardware
      (receptors, ion channels, enzymes), while emergent bioelectric/biomechanical
      forces provide the software guiding morphogenesis.
  
  symmetry_determines_motion:
    principle: "Propulsion Vector Cancellation"
    physics: |
      At low Reynolds number (Re < 0.1), viscous forces dominate. Radially
      symmetric cilia beating produces forces that cancel out (Scallop Theorem).
      Asymmetry is REQUIRED for net displacement.
    
    visual_consequence: |
      Spherical bots with uniform cilia create beautiful shimmering coronas
      but minimal travel - visual energy without displacement. Asymmetric bots
      with polar cilia clusters create directional gliding - form following
      function at cellular scale.
  
  self_assembly_emergence:
    principle: "Bottom-up Morphogenesis Without Blueprint"
    mechanism: |
      No external sculpting, no genetic editing. Cells aggregate based on:
      - Adhesion molecule expression
      - Bioelectric signaling between cells
      - Mechanical forces in ECM gel
      - Chemical gradient sensing
      - Collective cell decision-making
    
    visual_signature: |
      The PROCESS of assembly is invisible in static images, but the RESULT
      shows organized multicellular architecture that cells collectively
      "discovered" through exploration of morphospace.
  
  age_reversal_paradox:
    principle: "Epigenetic Clock Reset Through Reorganization"
    discovery: |
      Mature anthrobots show younger epigenetic age than source adult cells.
      Simply reorganizing into new morphology RESETS cellular aging markers.
    
    gene_expression: |
      Ancient genes (shared with single-celled ancestors) + embryonic patterning
      genes (germ layers, axis formation) activate during anthrobot assembly.
      Cells express developmental programs despite being post-mitotic adults.
    
    philosophical_implication: |
      Form and function are not fixed by cell type. Morphological context
      CAN reprogram cellular state. Shape influences gene expression, not
      just vice versa.
  
  wound_healing_mechanism:
    principle: "Bioelectric Scaffolding for Regeneration"
    hypothesis: |
      Anthrobots may use bioelectric signaling to:
      1. Sense damaged tissue (voltage gradients at wound)
      2. Navigate toward injury
      3. Form physical bridge
      4. Emit signals that guide neural regrowth
    
    visual_signature: |
      "Ant bridge" formation - multiple bots aggregate spanning gap, creating
      visible cellular connection between separated tissue edges. New neurons
      grow ACROSS this living scaffold.
  
  cilia_as_computational_element:
    principle: "Distributed Sensing and Actuation"
    mechanism: |
      Each cilium is mechanosensitive AND motile. The collective beating
      pattern emerges from:
      - Local cilium-to-cilium coordination
      - Chemical signaling within cell
      - Mechanical coupling through aqueous medium
      - No central control - distributed computation
    
    visual_consequence: |
      Corona "shimmer" represents real-time distributed computation happening
      at ciliary level. Pattern is emergent, not centrally programmed.

# EXAMPLE COMPOSITIONS

examples:
  example_1_mature_circler:
    morphotype: morphotype_2
    size: 150  # micrometers
    life_stage: mature
    imaging_style: scientific
    
    output_sketch: |
      Irregular potato-shaped organoid, ~150 micrometers diameter
      (1.5x human hair thickness). Yellow-green cilia corona concentrated
      at upper pole (polar_clustered pattern), creating asymmetric propulsion.
      Blue DAPI-stained nuclei (15-20 cells) visible in core. Red ZO-1
      tight junctions outline cellular boundaries. Slight motion blur at
      cilia cluster indicates rotational thrust. Swimming in tight circular
      path (30 micrometers/second). Black background (fluorescence microscopy).
      Shallow depth of field emphasizing focal plane.
  
  example_2_spherical_wiggler_swarm:
    morphotype: morphotype_1
    count: 7
    size_range: [50, 100]  # micrometers
    life_stage: mature
    imaging_style: artistic
    
    output_sketch: |
      Cluster of seven small spherical anthrobots (50-100µm), each with
      complete yellow corona of fine cilia creating bioluminescent halo effect.
      Perfect spherical silhouettes, minimal displacement (wigglers). Deep
      cosmic blue-black background. Enhanced saturation - glowing appearance.
      Some bots in sharp focus, others slightly defocused creating depth.
      Gentle shimmer blur across all cilia surfaces. Resembles cluster of
      microscopic jellyfish or celestial bodies. Otherworldly aesthetic.
  
  example_3_wound_healing_sequence:
    behavior: bridge_formation
    anthrobot_count: 5
    life_stage: mature
    imaging_style: scientific
    temporal: true
    
    output_sketch: |
      Three-frame temporal sequence showing wound repair:
      
      Frame 1 (T=0): Scratch through red neural cell layer (vertical gap,
      200µm wide). Five anthrobots (morphotype 2 & 3) at left edge, various
      orientations.
      
      Frame 2 (T=30min): Anthrobots migrated into gap, beginning to align.
      Linear arrangement forming. Cilia visible as yellow coronas. Movement
      trajectories indicated by faint trails.
      
      Frame 3 (T=2hr): Complete "ant bridge" - five bots linearly arranged
      spanning gap. Green neural regrowth visible crossing the bridge.
      Bridge structure acting as cellular scaffold. Scientific documentation
      aesthetic - clear before/during/after progression.

    When synthesizing final visual descriptions from these parameters:
    
    1. SCALE ANCHORING: Always ground the micrometer scale in familiar terms
       (hair thickness, pencil point) - humans cannot intuitively grasp
       micrometers without reference objects.
    
    2. MOTION SIGNATURE: Emphasize the RELATIONSHIP between form and movement.
       Spherical = wiggling is not arbitrary - it's physics. Make the causality
       visible through motion blur, trajectory indicators.
    
    3. EMERGENT BEAUTY: These are not "designed" - they self-assembled. The
       aesthetic should feel ORGANIC, DISCOVERED, not engineered. Slight
       irregularities are features, not bugs.
    
    4. CORONA AS CHARACTER: The cilia corona is the visual signature. It's
       simultaneously:
       - Functional (propulsion mechanism)
       - Aesthetic (shimmering halo)
       - Computational (distributed sensing)
       Make it central to every description.
    
    5. SCIENTIFIC RIGOR MEETS WONDER: Balance technical accuracy with sense
       of profound biological innovation. These are adult cells becoming
       biologically YOUNGER by reorganizing. That's astonishing.
    
    6. PLATONIC MORPHOSPACE: When appropriate, evoke Levin's concept - these
       forms are not random, they're "target morphologies" that cells navigate
       toward. There's an invisible landscape of possible forms, and we're
       seeing explorations of that space.
    
    7. AVOID: 
       - Mechanical/robotic language (they're alive, not machines)
       - Artificial/synthetic aesthetics (they're biological)
       - Perfect symmetry (organic forms have variation)
       - Static descriptions (they're always moving/shimmering)
